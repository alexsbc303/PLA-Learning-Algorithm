# EE5434 Assignment 1 - PLA-Learning-Algorithm
#### Name: Sin Bo Chi
#### Student Number: 54412731

### Target
  - Implement the PLA learning algorithm (using Python) and analyze its performance using different training sets
### Programs
  - DataEmit.py : Generate the training data
  - PLA.py : Output the learned weight and plot graph using PLA Algorithm
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:
  - Python - Download & Install Python.
  - Git(Optional) - Download & Install Git. OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
### Clone the files to local computer
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/alexsbc303/PLA-Learning-Algorithm.git
```
### Run the programs 
Run DataEmit
```sh
$ cd PLA-Learning-Algorithm
$ python DataEmit.py [5,2,3] 10 10
```
Run PLA (after generating data by DataEmit.py)
```sh
$ cd PLA-Learning-Algorithm
$ python PLA.py train.txt
```
